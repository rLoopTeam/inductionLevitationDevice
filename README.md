This is an opensource hardware design for an Induction Eddie-current 
Levitation Device.  With this device, a time varying magnetic field is 
generated by applying a multi-phase alternating current to a set of 
windings on a core.  The core can consist of a single wound lamination 
or a series of concentric lamiations.  The core is mounted on a gimbal 
providing two axes of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the core, 
therby permitting vectoring of the resultant force generated.
